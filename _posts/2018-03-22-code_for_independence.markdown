Independence is traditionally thought of as something we achieve when we leave our parents' homes. Get our first real job. Sign that lease. Finally get our own cell plans.

But independence from what, really? If all we're doing is switching our dependencies from our parents to our bosses, what are we gaining? The ability to sell our time to pay our bills? I don't know about you, but that's not that appealing to me anymore.

I graduated from my business undergraduate program a little under 4 years ago now. Upon graduation, I had landed a presitgious entry level position at a Big 4 consulting company. To me, life was made. I was jetsetting out to SF every week, rolling high on corporate dinners, and saving a pretty penny too. But when I decided I wanted to change projects, I realized what I had actually done is gotten comfy in my own little trap. I was still 100% under the direction and control of someone else. I couldn't steer my career any more than I could in college. Or in high school. I was on a pre-laid track and the destination was looking less and less savory.

3 years and two similar jobs later, it became clear that it didn't matter *what* boss I had. It was that I *had* a boss at all. I know, I know, that sounds priviledged. Little spoiled Kelsey has a nice job, boo hoo for you. But hear me out. 

Isn't this something we should all be striving for? In 2018, should we as a human race not be a little more in charge of our day to day lives? The freedom to work on what fuels our passions, or to take a sick kid to the doctor, or to build our own teams without needing crazy infrastructure. The more I learned to program, the more those things became available to me, and that, my friends, is what hooked me.

The simple truth is that education will set you free. And if you ask me, there is nothing better to learn right now than programming. The skills are in the highest demand, everything is always changing, the world's largest problems can be solved on the devices you're reading from right now. People will pay handsomely you for those skills or you hack your own startup in a weekend. Isn't that *wild?*

Those choices and opportunities feel a lot more like independence to me than slugging away as some business associate at a desk 9-5, doesn't it?
