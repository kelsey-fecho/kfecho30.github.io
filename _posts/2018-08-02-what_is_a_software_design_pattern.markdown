For budding developers, *software design patterns* are often woven into the many texts and tutorials we pour over. I've found that people can't articulate what a software design pattern is until they reach a more intermediate experience level.  By investing some time into design patterns (also known as *best practices*), you can save yourself countless hours by using a tried and true solution to whatever dilemma you're currently facing.

Most (all?) of us have encountered common design patterns already, whether we recognize them as such or not. Design patterns fit into one of three main categories:

1. Structural Design Patterns
2. Creational Design Patterns
3. Behavior Design Patterns


When creating new objects in Ruby or Javascript, you likely used some sort of *Factory Method*, which is a **creational design pattern**. I'm also guessing you've made *private classes*? Well, that's a great example of a **structural design pattern**? Ok, ok, one more... I'm sensing... you have experience in...*iterators*? BINGO, that's a **behavioral design pattern**.

See? Nothing really new here, just a little helpful demystifying.

Design patterns are language-agnostic, so you can pick them up and put them down in new projects to your heart's content. And the more familiar you are with the theory behind these ideas, the easier it will be to pick up new languages, or even new design patterns.

If you want to dig deeper, the holy grail of design patterns is often thought to be [this book by the Gang of Four.](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)
