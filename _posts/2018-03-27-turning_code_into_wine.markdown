My first portfolio project has arrived!

For my CLI Gem project, I built a Ruby gem that scrapes TotalWine.com and returns data about many different wines. Then, it allows users to interact with that data through a CLI app. Users can browse all wines, wines from a particular region, certain types of wine, or even in order of ratings. From there, interested users can be brought to TotalWine.com to purchase the wine about which they've just educated themselves.

I have to admit that starting with a blank code file was a little intimidating, but I'm really glad the project was structured that way. Sure, passing code challenges is one thing--someone else tells you exactly what the end result needs to do; all you need to do is build it. But here? I got to **design**.

I designed this gem using an Inside-Out design process, and I think that turned out alright because I'm still figuring out how the code pieces fit together. As I advance, I can certainly see how designing Outside-In would be the preferable method.

Overall this was a fun and satisfying project! It was great to see something jump into life from my keyboard.
